### A responsive webpage using **Flexbox**,  **CSS Grid** and **Media Queries** 

Hi! My name is **Jaia** and I'm a UX/UI & Product Designer who loves Front End Development.

**Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** were combined for the layout of the website and to achieve the desired styling of specific sections.
Links are clickable, opening in a new page and feature **CSS transitions** when hovering over them. 
Images from the gallery section feature **CSS scaling and box shadow** when hovering over them.
**Media Queries** were used to adapt the layout and pictrue gallery when viewing in smaller screens. This webpage was originally designed for a 1280px resolution. It's responsive up to 320px. 
**HTML** markup is semantic, CSS classes and root file are named and organized according to **BEM Methodology.**
The **language links** on the header section **will stay underlined** according to the page the user is viewing. I accomplished this using **CSS only.**

Overall, this project has been super fun to make, I truly meant it when I said it was built with :heart:.

### Next steps
* Learn how to keep the language link underlined using JavaScript instead of CSS. 
* Setting up the Spanish version of the website. I want to make it accessible for people who don't understand English.

Thank you for stopping by! :nerd_face:
