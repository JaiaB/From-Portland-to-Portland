### A responsive webpage using **Flexbox**,  **CSS Grid** and **Media Queries** 

Hi! My name is **Jaia** and I'm a UX/UI & Product Designer who loves Front End Development.

**Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** were combined for the layout of the website and to achieve the desired styling of specific sections. I used a 4 column layout instead of 12. Links are clickable, opening in a new page and feature **CSS transitions** when hovering over them. **Media Queries** were used to adapt the layout and pictrue gallery when viewing in smaller screens. This webpage was originally designed for a 1280px resolution. It's responsive up to 320px. **Rem** units are used for the typography on the page.
**HTML** markup is semantic, CSS classes and root file are named and organized according to **BEM Methodology**.
The **language links** on the header section **will stay underlined** according to the page the user is viewing. I accomplished this using **CSS only.**
The **ES** link will take you to the Spanish version of the website. I had so much fun translating it since **Spanish is my first language and I felt like people deserve a true to meaning translation.** 
Overall, this project has been super fun to make, I truly meant it when I said it was built with :heart:.

### Next steps
* Adding different CSS scale transforms to the images when users view the page on desktop.
* Learn how to keep the language link underlined using JavaScript instead of CSS. 

Thank you for stopping by! :nerd_face:
